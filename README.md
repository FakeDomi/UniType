### UniType ###

UniType allows you to quickly enter any Unicode character. Simply press ALT and + to open the input window, enter the character number and press ENTER. Cancel by pressing ESCAPE.
When the input window is open, pressing + toggles the input mode. Currently, there are *Unicode* and *Katakana* input modes.
